        // What is Sass?
        /*  stands for Syntactically Awesome Stylesheet
        - Sass is an extension to CSS
        - Sass is a CSS pre-processor
        - Sass is completely compatible with all versions of CSS
         - Sass reduces repetition of CSS and therefore saves time.
         - Sass was designed by Hamption Catlin and developed by Natalie Weizenbaum in 2006 
         - Sass is free to download and use....
         
         
         
         // Why Use Sass?
          Stylesheets are getting larger, more compex and harder to maintain. THis is where a CSS pre-processor like variables, nested rules, mixins, imports,
          inheritance, built-in functions and other stuff.
          
          
          
          // How does SASS work? 
          A browser does not understand Sass code. Therefore, you will need a SASS pre-processor to convert SASS code into standard CSS.
          TIP:: Transpiting is a term for taking a source code written in one language and transfrom/translate it into another language.
          
          
          
          // SASS file Type: 
          SASS files has the ".scss" file extension
          
          
          
          // define primary colors:

          // define primary colors 
          $primary_1 = #a2b9bc;
          $pimary_2 = #b2ad7f;





        // Use the variables
        .main-header{
            background-color: $primary_1; //here you can put inline comment
        }
        
        
        
        
        
        // Sass Variables :: Variables are a ways to store information that you can re-use later.
        variables like :: strings, numbers, colors, booleans, lists, nulls  
        Sass uses the $ symbol, followed by a name, to declare variables.
        Syntax :: $variablename = value;
